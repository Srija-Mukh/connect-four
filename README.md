# connect-four

## About
A simple connect 4 game created using React.

## Installation

2. Install dependencies and node modules<br>

## Game instructions
This is a 2 player game, where one player1 plays with red counters and the player2 plays with yellow counters. The red counter always starts in game 1 and then in following games, the red and yellow counters alternate to take first turn. The first player to connect 4 colours either diagonally, horizontally or vertically, wins!

The "Reset" button can be used to reset the board at all points in the game, except when the game has been won. After a win, the "Play again" button can be used to start a new game. 

A score board at the bottom of the screen records how many times red and yellow counters win, since the last time the browser tab was refreshed. 

## Limitations and Improvements
- 708 x 782 is the minimum browser window size requried to play this game. A future improvement is to make this app mobile responsive.
